When used in conjunction with a custom skin (manicskin.osz), !manic will play osu!mania for you. And quite well too. Well enough to get my account permanently banned at least. Have a look at this [showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hu7usAlcnw).
So yeah, it's pretty damn good at what it does. It works by reading color values from certain areas of the screen. These colors are matched to the skin's colors. Currently only 4 key mode is supported, more on this later.
